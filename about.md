Hey there!

_This website serves as a central area for me to write about things that interest me and stuff I'm working on._

<br>

_So... about me_:

- [Dungeons & Dragons](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) player (D&D 3e through 5e) and have DM'd a homebrew 5e [Shadowfell](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowfell) campaign
- Hobbyist game designer & indie gamedev
- Electrician & general mechanic
- Programmer by hobby & trade
- [Golang](https://go.dev/) is my favorite programming language
- [Real-time Strategy (RTS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy) games are my favorite
- [Total Annihilation (1999)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Annihilation) remains as my favorite RTS game of all time

<br>

I will publish my own RTS game someday.

<br>

_I also make some mildly interesting stuff_:

- projects on [Github]({{ site.github }})
- minecraft datapacks / mods on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/Euheimr)

<br>

Sometimes I stream games, gamedev and programming on [Twitch.tv]({{ site.twitch }})!
